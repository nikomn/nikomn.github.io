  <h1>Blog - How did I become a software developer?</h1>
    <p>It was an accident really, I didn't plan it from the start or anything.
    I didn't even like modern computers, though I always had nostalgic feelings
    towards Commodore 64, ‘cause I had one when I was a child in the early 90’s.
    But it just so happened that I began dating a woman whose father was an old
    school Linux guru. And as I did not own a computer, the only computer we had
    was my girlfriend’s, and as you might have guessed it, it had Linux on it.
    The only problem was that my girlfriend did not really know how to maintain
    it and her father lived quite a distance away and could not help out all that
    often, for example to update a distro to a new version when the old
    release reached EOL.</p>
  
    <p>Fast forward to the year 2011 when my girlfriend was now my wife and when I
    had just gotten a new job. By then the computer had been needing an update for
    some time, but we really did not know how to do it. So we had not done it. And
    I was beginning to think that it could maybe be a really bad thing security wise.
    But what to do!? I mean you have to be a genius to be able to maintain
    Linux computers, right?</p>

    <p>Part of my new job at that time was to download some files from one place to
      another, and this had to be done on a certain computer that had the needed
      network connections or something. I did not know any other way to do that sort of
      a task than the way I had been instructed, ie. drag and drop the files one at a time
      and then wait until the download was done (they were large files and it took like 5
      minutes each) until downloading the next one in the same way (yeah, I know - it <i>would</i>
      have been much easier to just select them all and just drag and drop them and go
      do something else for awhile... but go tell it to the 2011 version of me!). So I
      had to spend a lot of time just sitting there waiting. Had no smartphone or any other
      way to pass the time. But there were books in the room. Tech books. And one of them
      was a book about Linux administration. So as I had no better thing to do, I just
      started browsing through it every time I was doing the downloads. And it really did
      not seem that tough after all. Maybe you actually don’t need to be a genius to be
      able to maintain Linux computers? (Or was I a genius and just did not know it?
      Spoiler: No.)</p>

    <p>With this newfound confidence I went and bought a Linux book and a used computer
      and began experimenting. I ended up diving deep and found out about different Linux
      distros and all kinds of cool programs and the Free Software movement and everything
      in between. I started reading Linux Professional Institute self study materials
      during my commute to and from work and listening to Linux podcasts at night. It was
      like being a first year student at Hogwarts or something! I loved all of it. It was
      one of the best and happiest times of my life.</p>

    <p>At work the environment was not Linux, though. But as I had fallen so much in love with
      bash at the time, I began to experiment with PowerShell, as that was the closest thing I had
      available. And so even at work, I just started to find more and more use cases where I
      could do things with a command line super fast and also things that would have been
      impossible with some GUI program. And another available tool I found really useful
      was Excel. I found out I could use Excel formulas to transform text copied
      from one place to some other form real easily. And little did I know this was the first
      step towards being a software developer in some way at least.</p>

    <p>As a friendly person who tends to want to help others, I began to offer different types of
      Excel solutions to my co-workers on all kinds of different tasks I noticed they had trouble
      doing by hand. And this sparked people's interest and I kind of ended up doing more and
      more complex Excel applications, for different people and different uses. I quickly reached
      the end of the road trying to push the envelope with just formulas, so the next logical
      step was to start using VBA macros. And from there my Excel apps just turned more and
      more complex as time went by. The fact that I had real end users all the time was a great
      and rewarding thing, as I got instant feedback and it also really made me think about the
      usability of the apps and how to ensure that the apps would not be easily broken, even
      if used inappropriately.</p>

    <p>Yet another fast forward to the year 2017. At this time I had already reached the end of
      the road as to how far Excel could be pushed. And so I had begun experimenting using all
      possible tools I had available. I was using complex PowerShell one liners (PowerShell
      scripts were blocked by default), batch-scripts, regex, Excel formulas and vba macros
      and notepad++ macros, ... But I still felt I could do more and was just artificially
      limited by my environment. Finally at this point in time I started to think: I really
      like doing the silly little Excels and whatever at work and people seem to really find
      them useful, but what is it that I am actually doing, when I do them? And then finally
      the light bulb turned on: all these years I had been a software developer, in some
      definition of the word, even if I did not know it. I also had had much more real users
      of the software that I had created than most self taught developers with my knowledge
      level, even if I felt like my apps were not “real” programs. But where to go from there?
      The most obvious road forward was to get a more formal education in the field so I
      started to study computer science at open university and got into university for
      real in 2019. And now it's 2022 and I now already have a Bachelor's degree and am
      studying for a Master's degree at the moment.</p>

      <p>But am I now finally a “real” developer? Well, this is a question that I am still
        trying to find out. I have technically been paid for doing some sort of “software”
        for actual end users for a decade and have a degree in computer science and during
        my studies have done all kinds of projects in all kinds of technologies. Does that
        count at all? You tell me.</p>
