  <h1>Welcome to my internet home!</h1>
  <p>Hi, I'm Niko! I'm currently studying Master's Programme in Computer Science
    at the University of Helsinki. Here you will find info about my projects.
    I might also write a blog post every now and then and the topics might not
    always be strictly revolving around techological topics. Maybe. Time will tell ;)</p>
  <p>One point of this page is that I am trying to learn CSS and try to see how
    much I can do by just using styles in CSS and without any readymade tools etc.
    (Twitter Bootstrap etc.), so the site might be a little ugly, sorry about that :(
  </p>

  <p>In case you are wondering what types of projects I have done so far check out the <a href="./projects.html">projects page</a></p>

  <p>If you want to know what types of technologies I am familiar with, check out <a href="./tierlist.html">my Technology Knowledge Tier List</a></p>

  <p>If you want to read my rambling writings, check out the <a href="./blog.html">blog page</a></p>
