  <h1>This is my homepage!</h1>
  <p>Hi, I'm Niko! I'm currently studying Master's Programme in Computer Science
    at the University of Helsinki.
    This page is just a test at the moment, but I will propably add more content here
    sometime soon...</p>
  <p>One point of this page is that I am trying to learn CSS and try to see how
    much I can do by just using styles in css and without any readymade tools etc.
    (Twitter Bootstrap etc.), so the site might be a little ugly, sorry about that :(
  </p>

  <p>In case you are wondering what types of projects I have done so far check out the <a href="./projects.html">projects page</a></p>
